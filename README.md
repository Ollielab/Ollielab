### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Hertfordshire with a strong interest in web development and infrastructure.

Alongside my studies, I run **Polarinfr Ltd**, where I build and experiment with software products.

I enjoy building real-world applications, exploring new technologies, and understanding how systems work behind the scenes.

#### Cloud-Based Note-Taking Application

I created **Spaces**, a cloud-based note-taking web application designed for simplicity, speed, and clean user experience.

- Full-stack web application   
- Built with scalability and performance in mind  
- Focused on structured thinking and productivity  

This project reflects my interest in combining clean frontend design with solid backend architecture.
